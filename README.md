# Vagrant Automation Example

Builds a Simple and Crude LAMP Stack

This Vagrantfile will build a single Ubuntu Bionic 64 virtual machine using VirtualBox.
Modify the Vagrantfile if a different hypervisor is desired.  Switch to the hashicorp/bionic64 box 
for VMware and Hyper-V.

Used for coursework in my classes.  Details are explained in those classes where I use this example.

The users.sql file is supplied as another example for using the Vagrant Provisioner.
